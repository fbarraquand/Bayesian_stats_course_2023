# Bayesian statistics course 

The programme is designed for U Bordeaux's *Sciences and Environment* Graduate School (with enrollment from students of other graduate schools). 
Requirements are a working knowledge of R, and some basic statistics (analysis of variance and regression). 
The course runs for 10 sessions of 3 hours each, roughly half-lectures half-practicals (TDs, *travaux dirig√©s*), although percentages may vary.

### Programme

1. [Objectives and philosophy of Bayesian statistics](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_1/Bayesian_statistics_1.pdf). TD1 Bayesian estimation of a proportion
2. [Revisiting the ANOVA in a Bayesian framework](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_2/Bayesian_statistics_2.pdf). TD2 Getting acquainted with software (JAGS), coding the first models
3. [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_3/Bayesian_statistics_3.pdf) (i.e., algorithms for Bayesian statistics). Practicals within the course: Monte Carlo integration, rejection sampling, Metropolis algorithm
4. [From fixed to random effects, introduction to mixed models](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_4/Bayesian_statistics_4.pdf). TD4 variance partitioning (with thorough convergence diagnostics). 
5. [Mixed models. A hint of Poisson GLMs](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_5/Bayesian_statistics_5.pdf). TD5 mixed models following up on TD4 (done first)
6. [Generalized linear models for counts](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_6/Bayesian_statistics_6.pdf). TD6 GLM(Ms) Poisson LN (fitting diagnostics, posterior predictive checks). 
7. [Binomial/Bernoulli GLM(Ms)](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_7/Bayesian_statistics_7.pdf) (importance of priors in original and transformed scale). TD7 Binomial ANOVA. 
8. [Nonlinear models (organism growth, population growth)](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_8/Bayesian_statistics_8.pdf). TD8 Gompertz organism growth. 
9. [Latent variable models](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_9/Bayesian_statistics_9.pdf). TD9 occupancy model (0/1 data with added observation process). 
10. [Model selection in a Bayesian setting](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_stats_course_2023/blob/master/session_10/Bayesian_statistics_10.pdf). TD10 Linear and nonlinear model comparison.
